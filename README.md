## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words


We got our dataset from Kaggle and it was also used in the book *Machine Learning With R* by Brett Lantz. Our dataset is roughly 13 hundred rows by 7 columns. The 7 columns are age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoker, geographical region, and medical charges. The data is from 2018 and contains data on people from across the USA. The data originally comes from an insurance agency but in its most recent publishing, it served as training data for machine learning. The data was collected by an insurance company as information voluntarily contributed by insurees.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words


Our hopes for this analytics project are to learn how to properly clean, prepare, and visualize data in such a way as to gain the maximum amount of information possible from a given dataset. Furthermore, it is our hope that we may gain valuable insight into the interesting world of medical insurance and in what ways we might change our lives to live healthier (and pay less for medical insurance!) This dataset initially piqued our interest because it is easy to understand and we felt that there could be some really quite interesting relationships hidden in there. For instance, how much more do smokers actually pay in meducal costs? How does having children change the amount paid in medical expenses, and what happens as the number of children increases? Are there certain geographical regions that pay more or less? Which geographical regions have the highest BMI? There are many questions that came jumping out at us upon looking over this dataset and we look forward to building a user-facing dashboard with it.
